As a brass arranger, I mix woodwind, string and vocal parts to create aesthetically pleasing playback to test my compositions.
I cannot use tpt. tbn. horn or tuba--the tbn particularly for playback sounds like ass.
I intend to record authentic tbn, euph, bar & mellophone voices, each in prof. 6+ octaves
I'll need some help with tpt. and especially tuba, my chops could never get a good buzz on that gigantic mthpc. 
Plz let me know where/how to upload improved voices once completed.

If any all-star tone/range Contra or Soprano dudes care to lend an assist, hit me up. I have my own gridserver I'm to happy donate
free time/allocation to make this collection of 5 voices (Bb tpt, Bb/F Mellophone, Tbn, Bar, Euph, Tuba) in a 6+ oct range
simple. That's voices(6) x 6+ chromatics for each(6.5x12) that's ~1000 wavs all in. anyone with me? 

I have a Getzen 1050 tbn, 
a Kanstul 3v Bar Bugle in G and Kanstul Custom Class 3v Mellophone in G. I could use a talented player 
with a Bach/Kanstul tpt/soprano
and another w/ a King/Yamaha/Jupiter or equiv Tuba OR Kanstul/King Contra 3v or 4v in G. Thx. No French Horns needed.

For high brass plz use a CG3 for tpt/sop and a 1 1/2 for Middle/Mello. Any rounded-tapered, silver or gold dark bach mthpc for 
Tuba is fine. If you wish to make tbn bar sounds you MUST use a Bach 6 1/2 AL or 5G.

Banned equipment: Dynasty/DEGs, anything not made of brass, shallow-cup or ANY mthpc "enhancements" all Dennis Wyck mthpcs.
electronic amplification or modifications, must be as organic as possible.
All Marcikowitz (sp?) mthpcs.

Banned voicing: false partials. Pedals ok if you can make them sound dark and rich.
Any upper-register that sounds "pinched" or lacking air-support.

Misc requiremets: 
Focus on air/buzz only, not tongue. prefer "hah" (no tongue) articulation but "dah" also acceptable.
A = 440.
Play through center of the horn, slightly oblique embouchures are ok so long as the air travel is same.
Embouchures above or below Arban/Rochut/Meehan/Westman standards unacceptable.
Full, open, relaxed, dark tone for all notes is a must. No vibrato at this pt.
Release notes by breating IN. That is all.
Plz don't blow flat on the 4th partial or worse....SHARP on the 5th and 8va.
Experts/Hacks/Pro's only plz. 

In future: Consider providing common chords like Ctriad with G 5cents sharp and E 33 cents
flat for chord accuracy&ring/overtone dev. later on. Thx.
